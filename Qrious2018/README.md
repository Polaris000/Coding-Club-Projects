## Introduction  
This is the pre-apogee event conducted by the Coding Club anually.  
It has been done completely by the 2017-2018 first-year web-dev batch at the coding club.  
  
Qrious 2018 is a webapp based puzzle game, where a player has to get through levels which  
different types of puzzles like crytpo, jumbled words, pic-connect and fill ins.  

### Story line  
The player has been sentenced to life time imprisonment for infiltrating the US government   
and selling classified data to the Russians.  

The player is nicknamed "Rootoor".  

The leader of a mafia dealing in AI weaponry is willing to give the player freedom in return for  
diamonds and his own dirty work. The mafia easily hacks into the high security prison and takes  
control of the AI robots.

The player's path ahead is not that easy of course. The mafia leader wants to test the player  
at the same time to see if he is still has it in him.

The robots, which are under the control of the mafia help the player on his journey, giving  
him hints and assistance in exchange for diamonds.

The player gets through doors only when he solves certain puzzles.

### Details

Storyline is shown at start.

Each level on a different page to make it more interesting and there are 8 levels  
in all.  
Each level has a different question theme like cryptograms, crosswords, piconnect etc.  
An AI robot guards each level.

Player has 100 diamonds at the start.

Level 1 has one cell door and all subsequent levels except last level have 4 doors.

Diamonds earned per layer: 50n, 100n, 200n and 400n.

#### Cost of
        help: 50% of total diamonds player gets
        hint: 25% of total diamonds player gets
        
Last level has only 1 door worth 1000 diamonds with a really difficult question.

Levels 1, 3, 5 and 7 have bonus questions for which you get red, blue, green or yellow emeralds.

#### Purpose of emeralds:
Last level can also be solved by using all four coloured emeralds on the lock, instead of  
solving the really hard question.

#### Note:
The player will be told that the emeralds will have certain benefits but not that the last level  
can be solved with emeralds (suspense)
        


### Concepts
Static and media file integration with a Django backend  
Using JSON for asynchronous pages  
Hosting a site on pythonanywhere  

### Takeaways
1. Learnt how difficult coordination and managemnent becomes as more people are involved  
2. Learnt the importance of time management  
3. Learnt how to host a site as well as the above concepts
4. A team should plan the entire layout before implementation as modifying something later is  
   very difficult.
